This code proves that there exists a unique solution to the pricing problem on a network. That is, there exists a unique 'survivors' function *φ* that, given a set of banks *A* and some change in asset values making *A* unviable, prescribes a new set of surviving banks maximal among viable subsets of *A*. The correct pricing at every point in phase space follows.

We call a set of banks viable if the equity calculation assuming all its members survive gives rise to a positive valuation for every member.

Assumptions are of a solution procedure ℋ for debt valuations and a solution procedure ℰ for equity valuations, satisfying certain properties, and that for every set of banks there is some amount by which assets could fall to make it unviable, whatever the solution to the debt pricing problem.
